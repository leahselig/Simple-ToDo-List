# A Simple ToDo List

<img src="ToDo-Screenshot.jpg" alt="ToDo List">

This is a basic CRUD app that lets you create your own ToDo list. Enter your tasks and as you complete them, simply click the task to have it completed and removed from the list. This was created using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

## Installation
